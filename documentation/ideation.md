# Ideation

## Tabu-Search:
- Tabu List: Complete solutions
- Tabu list $\leadsto$ empty neighborhood: Clear tabu-list or restart search


## Simulated annealing


## Combination of all
Combine all three algorithms and use the LNS as *main* component. Apply the Tabu-list, when the possible weekly combinations are created. Additionally, search for literature to use the saturation parameter of Simulated-annealing.

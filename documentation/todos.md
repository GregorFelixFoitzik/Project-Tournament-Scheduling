# To-Dos

- [x] Create final file(s)
- [ ] LNS:
  - [x] Reorder weeks
    - [x] Maximum profit (takes too long)
    - [x] At random
  - [ ] Adapt weights for selection of method (starting with random -> later the other method(s))
- [ ] Select time-consuming operations not at the end of iterations -> Change more 
- [x] Tabu-Search:
  - [x] Only change weeks, which are not changed
  - [x] Save certain week combinations, which are allowed
- [ ] VNS:
  - [ ] Reorder different number of weeks, so profit is maximized
- [x] Implement Grid-Search for finding optimal parameters
- [ ] Combination of all
- [ ] Pseudocode
- [ ] Search for papers: Round-robin-timetabeling
- [ ] Check code
- [x] Check for `NotImplementedErrors`

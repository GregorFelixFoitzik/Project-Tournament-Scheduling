## Questions
- $r = 1$:
  - Week 1: A vs B
  - Week 2: A vs B is not allowed
  - Week 3: B vs A

## Literature
- Search for machine scheduling problems
- Sports scheduling
- Summarize it
- **IMPORTANT:** See lecture 31_MM34_MH_V02_Heuristics slide, page 11/12

## Validator for solutions
- 2 people create one independently of each other
- Create synthetic datasets:
  - Validate those
- The following requirements should be fulfilled:
  - Output as described in the document 
  - Check for validity: Is the solution feasible regarding the constraints

## Algorithm development
- Brainstorm about possible algorithms
- Genetic algorithms etc.: Combination of multiple ones

## Pseudocode
- LaTeX template and write down the pseudocode

## Command line parser
- @Jonas

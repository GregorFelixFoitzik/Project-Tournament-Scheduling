## Jonas 
- [x] Create final file(s)
- [x] Tabu-Search:

  - [x] Save certain week combinations, which are allowed
- [x] Implement Grid-Search for finding optimal parameters
- [x] Check for `NotImplementedErrors`
- [ ] LNS:
  - [x] Reorder weeks
    - [x] Maximum profit (takes too long)
    - [x] At random
  - [ ] Adapt weights for selection of method (starting with random -> later the other method(s))
